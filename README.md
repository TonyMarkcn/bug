# bug
my package is wrong , but i dont know how to fix it.
'ScrollView' does not contain a definition for 'horizontalScrollerVisibility' and no accessible extension method 'horizontalScrollerVisibility' accepting a first argument of type 'ScrollView' could be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)
